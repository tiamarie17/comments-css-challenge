# Project Description

Your challenge is to build out this comments section in HTML and CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible:

![Design preview for the Interactive comments section coding challenge](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

Pay especially **careful attention to margin and padding**, and to **alignment**. The app should cohesive, but not claustrophobic.

See [./design/desktop-design.jpg](./design/desktop-design.jpg). Icons and images are located in [./images/](./images/).

Note that SVG images can be used just like any other image, eg:

```html
<img alt="edit" src="./images/icon-edit.svg" />
```

## Style Guide

### Active states

To see how various elements change style when you click/hover/interact with them, see [./design/active-states.jpg](./design/active-states.jpg).

For **base mode** buttons should have hover and active styles. Any interactivity (eg, clicking _Reply_ opens a form) is a **stretch goal**.


### Colors

You can reference these colors in your CSS, eg:

```css
.someElement {
    color: hsl(238, 40%, 52%);

    /* or */
    background-color: hsl(239, 57%, 85%);

    /* or */
    border: 1px solid hsl(211, 10%, 45%);
}
```

#### Primary

- Moderate blue: hsl(238, 40%, 52%)
- Soft Red: hsl(358, 79%, 66%)
- Light grayish blue: hsl(239, 57%, 85%)
- Pale red: hsl(357, 100%, 86%)

#### Neutral

- Dark blue: hsl(212, 24%, 26%)
- Grayish Blue: hsl(211, 10%, 45%)
- Light gray: hsl(223, 19%, 93%)
- Very light gray: hsl(228, 33%, 97%)
- White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)

### Typography

#### Body Copy

- Font size (paragraph): 16px

#### Font

- Family: [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik)

The font is already setup in your [index.html](./index.html). Example usage:

```css
.someElement {
    font-family: 'Rubik', sans-serif;
}
```
